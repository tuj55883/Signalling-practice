# Signalling-practice
This was an assignment from my operating systems class to practice signal sending and recieving between processes. All it does is simulate signals either for a certain amount of time or for a certain amount of signals. Then logs all the information on in seperate text files. Information like, time between signals, amount of signals and when they were sent.
# What I Learned
-How to combine multiprocessing and threads
-The process of catching and sending signals
-Practice with data computation and logging
